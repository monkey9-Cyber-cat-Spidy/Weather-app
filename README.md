## How It Works 🤔

1. **Geocoding:**  
   The app uses the Nominatim API (OpenStreetMap) to convert your location (city, state, or country) into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). 🌍

2. **Fetching Weather Data:**  
   With your coordinates, the app calls the Open‑Meteo API to retrieve current weather data. 🔄

3. **Rendering Data & Map:**  
   The app dynamically builds a table to display current weather data and renders an interactive map showing the location with a marker and popup. 📝🗺️

4. **Animations:**  
   GSAP adds smooth animations to page elements (header, form, data container, and download button) to create a lively, interactive experience. 💫

5. **JSON Download:**  
   The full JSON response is stored and linked to a download button, so you can download the complete weather data whenever you need it. 📂
